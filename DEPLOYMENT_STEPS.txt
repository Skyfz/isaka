### Steps for Publishing Development Deployment

1. **Stage Changes:**
   ```
   git add -A
   ```

   This command stages all changes for commit, including new files, modified files, and deleted files.

2. **Commit Changes:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

   Replace `"Your commit message"` with a concise and descriptive message that summarizes the changes made in this commit.

3. **Push to Remote Repository:**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

   This command pushes your committed changes to the `main` branch of the remote repository named `origin`. Make sure to replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you're working on a different branch.

Additional Information (Missing):

- Before pushing changes, ensure that your local repository is up to date with the remote repository by pulling any changes from the remote:
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```

- If conflicts arise during the pull or push process, resolve them locally before proceeding with the commit and push steps.

- It's good practice to review your changes using `git status` before committing to ensure that only intended changes are included in the commit.

- Consider running tests or performing any necessary validations locally before pushing changes to the remote repository.

- After pushing changes, you may want to inform your team members or stakeholders about the updates made and any relevant information they need to know.

Feel free to add any specific details or customize these steps further based on your workflow and requirements.
